The cost of running What The Fuck Just Happened Today isn't free. It's [my full-time job](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/meta/trump-creates-one-new-job/) and I'm determined to keep this ad-free and sustainable.

Here's a rough estimate of the monthly costs required to run WTFJHT:

**Hosting:**
The site is hosted on Amazon S3 because it's highly scalable, reliable, fast, and generally an inexpensive data storage infrastructure option. I also use CloudFlare to manage my DNS, SSL certificate, and handle caching. *Monthly Cost:* \~$100

**Podcast and Hosting:**
I use AWS S3 to host the [daily podcast](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/podcasts/) and cache the files with AWS CloudFront. I also pay Joe for producing and recording the daily podcast. Although he loves doing it, I strongly feel that people deserve to be compensated for their work. I provide him with a monthly stipend. *Monthly Cost:* \~$2000

**S3 Stat:**
Spending all this money hosting a podcast doesn't mean much if you can't measure it. Using [S3 Stat](https://www.s3stat.com) let's me easily understand who is playing what pod on what device. *Monthly Cost:* $10

**Live Chat:**
I like to engage with the WTF family, so I've installed Chat.io, a livechat widget on the site. *Monthly Cost:* $10

**Site Search:**
This giant repository of news isn't very valuable if you can't find what you're looking for. I've implemented [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/), the best instant search option out there. *Monthly Cost:* $59

**Email Service:**
Oh boy, here's one of the most expensive parts of running the site. I use [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/) because the ease of use, templating, reporting, and pre-built forms are the best in the business. While there are cheaper options out there, the time-savings is worth it.

MailChimp charges based on the number of subscribers you have AND the number of monthly emails sent. WTFJHT sends more than 2.5M emails/month.

The costs of sending email will continue to go up as WTFJHT grows. MailChimp is an awesome company and they've provided us with a 15% discount. *Monthly Cost:* At least $800; usually more.

**Yellow Brim:**
A huge issue with sending newsletters is that it's easy to mess up the formatting. This is compounded by publishing WTFJHT as a blog post first, then reproducing it in MailChimp as an email second. I use a tool by a startup called Yellow Brim, which allows me to quickly convert the daily update into a perfectly formatted email newsletter. I save at least 45-minutes a day by using this tool. *Monthly Cost:* $75 

**WTF Member Forum:**
The [WTF Member Forum](https://talk.whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/) is a community that exists 24/7/365 to discuss the news, coordinate actions, share perspectives, and connect with likeminded people. It's a [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) community hub, which is amazing, free, and open sourced. It needs to be hosted somewhere, however. The provider of choice is [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com). *Monthly Cost:* \~$20

**NewsWhip Spike:**
I recently started using [Spike by NewsWhip](https://www.newswhip.com/newswhip-spike/) to help me more quickly source the daily news. Their tool is incredible, but very expensive. They belive in the WTF mission and cut me a deal for access. *Monthly Cost:* $100

**Python Anywhere:**
I built a news aggregator called [Current Status](https://currentstatus.io/) to help me source the top political news from across the web. I host it on Python Anywhere. *Monthly Cost:* $20

**News Subscriptions:**
Quality journalism ain't free. I have subscriptions to the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, and a few others. *Monthly Cost:* \~$75

**Freelancers:**
Being your own boss is great, but nothing gets done if I take a day off. To hire a freelance writer/editor and social media editor to help write and produce WTFJHT when I'm unable to costs about $200-$250/day all-in. *Monthly Cost:* \~$3000

**My Labor:**
Here's my conservative daily breakdown in time spent:

* 3-5 hours researching and collecting stories

* 2-4 hours writing and curating the daily post

* 2-3 hours producing the newsletter, setting up the post, cutting images, publishing, troubleshooting, fixing typos

* 1-3 hours community management and social media distribution on Twitter and Facebook

* 1-4 hours site maintenance, help desk/support, etc

And, since I'm both the writer/editor and web developer running this, let's pretend my salary is the average between the two professions in Seattle, via Glassdoor: [News Editor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/seattle-news-editor-salary-SRCH_IL.0,7_IM781_KO8,19.htm): $63,718. [Senior Web Developer](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/seattle-senior-web-developer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,7_IM781_KO8,28.htm): $98,464. *Monthly Cost:* ($63,718 \+ $98,464) / 2 = $81,091/year. <strong>$6,757</strong>

**Risk Adjustment:**
Quitting a salaried job that included full benefits to run a blog/newsletter that's supported entirely by an optional, pay-whatever-you-want contribution model comes with substantial risk. While I'm prepared to experience some variable income, I'm not prepared to run WTFJHT at a loss for an extended period of time. This risk adjustment is also responsible for covering things like personal health care, taxes, and various who-knows-wtf fees that come with the territory. *Monthly cost*: 15% of total cost

---

**TOTAL MONTHLY COST:**

\$3,269 (hosting, email, tools, etc.) \+ $3,000 (freelancers) \+ $6,757 (my labor) = \~$13,026 \+ $1,953.9 (15% risk adjustment) = <strong>$14,979.90</strong>.

As you can see, nobody is getting rich here. It's not like there's a WTF 401(k) plan, paid time off, sick leave, or corporate perks, let alone full-time employees. The truth is that while it's nice to work from home, it's also lonely. Someday I'd like to afford a desk at a co-working space. 

I hope this transparency addresses any concerns you may have and demonstrates why your support is critical to keeping WTF Just Happened Today going strong. So, please [become a member today](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/membership/).
