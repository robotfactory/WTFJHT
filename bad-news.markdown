**Everyone**: Did you hear the news?

**Everybody**: From yesterday?

**Everyone**: Yeah.

**Everybody**: I did, yeah. Awful.

**Everyone**: What the hell is going on right now?

**Everybody**: I don’t know. It’s insane.

**Everyone**: How about that thing from last night?

**Everybody**: Oh, my God, I saw that—how does it keep happening?

**Everyone**: Doesn’t make sense.

**Everybody**: Then I woke up this morning and saw that other thing.

**Everyone**: Yeah, that was so sad. Beyond sad. How about later this morning, remember that thing?

**Everybody**: I forgot about that. Jesus.

**Everyone**: Did you hear what just happened?

**Everybody**: When?

**Everyone**: Just now, while we were talking.

**Everybody**: No, I must have missed it. I was trying to do a news blackout for a little while. Is it bad?

**Everyone**: Really bad.

**Everybody**: Worse than the thing that happened when you said “really bad”?

**Everyone**: I don’t know about worse—it was different.

**Everybody**: What did you say?

**Everyone**: I said it was different.

**Everybody**: Sorry, I’m a little distracted because something horrifying just happened.

**Everyone**: Really? What?

**Everybody**: Wait, false alarm. I think I imagined it because I couldn’t deal with the lull.

**Everyone**: After that last thing, I promised myself I was going to do something—you know, like, get active.

**Everybody**: So what did you do?

**Everyone**: I tweeted.

**Everybody**: Did you really? What did you write?

**Everyone**: I wrote, “This has to STOP!!!”

**Everybody**: How many exclamation points did you use? Did you capitalize any of it?

**Everyone**: Three. And yes.

**Everybody**: You’re on the front lines of change.

**Everyone**: I know.

**Everybody**: Maybe I should try a news blackout for a little while, too.

**Everyone**: You should. It’s healthy.

**Everybody**: O.K. I’m doing it right now.

**Everyone**: Oh, my God! You just missed the craziest shit.

**Everybody**: I knew that was going to happen! I hate how out of touch I am.

**Everyone**: There’s so much going on lately that I feel like I’m getting numb to it all. Do you ever worry about that?

**Everybody**: Yeah.

**Everyone**: Sometimes I just stare at terrible things on the screen with zero emotion on my face. Then eventually I snap out of it and start pointing and laughing, so that’s good.

**Everybody**: I’m scared I’m getting numb to things, too, but then I wake up screaming from asphyxiating night terrors and I’m relieved I’m still normal.

**Everyone**: There’s so much anger and helplessness flooding my thoughts, I worry that soon there won’t be any room for other emotions, like dread.

**Everybody**: The key for me has been to stop enjoying happiness. I’ve trained myself to actually be repulsed by it—that way I don’t miss it.

**Everyone**: I did that with hope. It’s great.

**Everybody**: I hate puppies now.

**Everyone**: They’re hideous.

**Everybody**: You know those moments between crying about one thing and crying about the next thing, when you finally have time to catch your breath and just cry about nothing?

**Everyone**: Yeah, but I feel like I’ve been taking those moments for granted—

**Everybody**: Sorry to interrupt, but I just saw what’s going to happen in, like, ten minutes, and it’s not good.

**Everyone**: Wait, you can see the future?

**Everybody**: Yes, I can.

**Everyone**: You mean you’re no longer a prisoner of the twenty-four-hour news cycle? You can see more?

**Everybody**: The future news cycle is within all of our grasps—you just need to know how to unlock it.

**Everyone**: Will you show me?

**Everybody**: Yes. But I warn you—you must truly want to see.

**Everyone**: I do want to see. I want to see everything!

**Everybody**: Then close your eyes.

**Everyone** (laughing manically): I see . . . I see everything. It’s horrible. Thank you!

**Everybody**: You’re welcome. ♦
