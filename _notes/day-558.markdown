1. **Paul Manafort's tax and bank fraud trial starts today.** The trial is the first in connection with Robert Mueller's ongoing investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Collusion and Russia, however, are not likely to come up during the trial. Mueller is expected to focus instead on Manafort's business dealings and his lobbying work on behalf of the pro-Kremlin Ukrainian government. It is unclear whether Manafort will take the stand at any point during the trial. Yesterday, Manafort's attorneys dropped his appeal to halt Mueller's investigation, but offered no comment as to why the appeal was abandoned.

2. **The Trump administration is considering a unilateral $100 billion tax cut for the wealthy.** The maneuver would cut the capital gains tax and change the definition of "cost" for calculating capital gains, allowing taxpayers to adjust the initial value of an asset like a home or a stock to account for inflation when it sells. The use of executive power to enact such a significant change would be highly unusual and could be open to a legal challenge. George W. Bush considered a similar move, but rejected it because it was seen as an overreach of the Treasury's authority and only attainable by an act of Congress.

3. **A federal judge ordered the government to transfer all but the most troubled migrant children from an immigration detention facility in Texas that has allegedly [forced children to take psychotropic drugs](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/u-s-centers-force-migrant-children-take-drugs-lawsuit-n885386?icid=related)** regardless of their conditions and without their parents' consent. U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee found the conditions at the Shiloh Treatment Center to be in violation of a 1997 settlement known as Flores v. Reno, which requires officials to place detained minors "in the least restrictive setting appropriate to (each Class Member's) age and special needs."

4. **Trump's offer to meet with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani without preconditions was later rejected by Trump's own administration and one of Rouhani's advisers.** After Trump said he would meet with Iran "any time they want to," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo contradicted him and said, "If the Iranians demonstrate a commitment to make fundamental changes in how they treat their own people, reduce their malign behavior, can agree that it’s worthwhile to enter in a nuclear agreement that actually prevents proliferation, then the president said he’s prepared to sit down and have a conversation with him." One of Rouhani's advisers said that "respect for the great nation of Iran" and a return to the Iran nuclear deal were necessary preconditions for a meeting.

5. **Russia's top diplomat claimed his country has access to insider information about U.S. military plans.** Sergey Lavrov said Moscow would be well-informed of any international attempts to undermine Russia. "Rest assured," Lavrov said, "we will be provided with information about the schemes harbored by the militaries of both the U.S. and other Western countries against the Russian Federation."
