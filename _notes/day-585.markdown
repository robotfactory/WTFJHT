1. **A former doorman at Trump World Tower says he is free to discuss an alleged affair between Trump and one of his former housekeepers that resulted in an illegitimate child.** Dino Sajudin entered into a "source agreement" with American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer, to "provide AMI with information regarding Donald Trump's illegitimate child." The agreement was signed on Nov. 15, 2015, and prohibited Sajudin from discussing the matter with anyone, although it does not contain any additional details about the story itself. The source agreement is commonly referred to as a "catch-and-kill" agreement, during which a publication purchases the rights to a source's story, prohibits the source from discussing it, and then refuses to publish it, effectively burying the story.

2. **A government watchdog group has found a discrepancy between Trump's financial disclosures and the payments he made to his former attorney Michael Cohen.** Trump's financial disclosure form states that he "fully reimbursed" Cohen between $100,001 and $250,000 in 2017, but court documents filed by federal prosecutors state that Cohen received $420,000 from the Trump Organization over the course of that year. "It is quite notable," said Scott Amey, general counsel of the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight. "This may constitute a false statement by the president. If they were paying him $420 \[thousand\] they should have put the whole amount in there."

3. **Stormy Daniels says she would "happily" testify before Congress about the $130,000 hush money payment she received from Trump in 2016 via Michael Cohen.** "If Donald Trump has done things he shouldnâ€™t have during his campaign, he should be impeached," Daniels told the Daily Mirror. She added: "I'll happily testify under oath and prove my story is true."

4. **Trump met with a prominent QAnon conspiracy theorist in the Oval Office last week**, according to photos posted on the man's Twitter account. Michael Lebron, known as Lionel in online circles, is described on his own websites as "an avowed conspiracy analyst." Photos posted to Lionel's Twitter account show him with Trump in the Oval Office and touring the White House. "There are simply no words to explicate the profound and ineffable honor of meeting @realDonaldTrump in the tabernacle of liberty, the Oval Office," Lionel tweeted. "@LynnShawProd and I so appreciate @POTUS' kindness and courtesy. #MAGA."

5. **Trump rejected a plan to release an official statement about the death of Sen. John McCain that praised his military service and called him a "hero."** Sarah Huckabee Sanders, John Kelly, and other White House staffers advocated for a statement lauding McCain's career, but Trump told them he wanted to post a brief tweet instead, and the statement was not released. Shortly after McCain's death was announced, Trump tweeted: "My deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain. Our hearts and prayers are with you!"

6. **Trump was photographed incorrectly coloring in a picture of the American flag during a visit to a children's hospital in Ohio.** Trump added a blue stripe to the flag instead of the 13 alternating red and white stripes that represent the 13 original colonies. The photo of Trump's flag-coloring session was first tweeted by Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, before it was picked up by other Twitter users.
