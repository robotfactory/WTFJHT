1. **An immigration lawyer says an immigrant child died while in ICE custody "as a result of possible negligent care and a respiratory illness she contracted from one of the other children."** Immigration and Customs Enforcement put out a statement on Twitter claiming that the reports are not true. Mana Yegani is an immigration lawyer from Houston who claimed in a series of tweets on Tuesday that an unidentified child had died while under the care of ICE inside a Texas detention center. There has been no confirmation regarding the location of the child's parents, but Yegani says the child's grandmother is in New Jersey.

2. **Trump called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end the Mueller investigation "right now."** Trump tweeted that "This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further." He continued: "Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!"

3. **Robert Mueller has referred three investigations into possible illicit foreign lobbying to New York prosecutors who are already handling the case against Michael Cohen.** All three cases are linked to Paul Manafort, who brought other Washington lobbyists and lawyers into his work on behalf of Ukrainian politicians. The cases are examining whether those lobbyists also failed to register as foreign agents and how they were paid. None of the three men have been charged with a crime, but Mueller's team has subpoenaed or requested documents from all three of their firms.

4. **U.S. prosecutors arrested several suspected Ukrainian hackers charged with stealing troves of data from American companies.** The suspects allegedly belong to a hacking group called Cabanak, which law enforcement and private cyber investigators say is one of the world's most prolific cyber crime organizations.

5. **China promised to retaliate against the United States if Trump imposes an additional 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.** The tariffs would target thousands of Chinese imports, and raising the proposed tariffs from 10 to 25 percent would escalate the already heated trade dispute between the world's two largest economies. "Unilateral threats and pressure will only produce the opposite of the desired result," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang.

6. **Trump is considering another sharp reduction in the number of refugees admitted into the United States.** One plan under consideration calls for no more than 25,000 refugees resettlements next year, a cut of more than 40 percent from this year's limit. It would be the lowest number of refugees admitted to the country since the start of the program in 1980.

7. **A scammer tried to get inside information about U.S. sanctions on Russia by calling a U.S. senator and pretending to represent a Latvian official.** Sen. Jeanne Shaheen was contacted through her staff by someone who called himself Arturs Vaiders and claimed to be working for the Latvian foreign ministry in order to discuss the "prolongation of anti-Russian sanctions" and "general security with Kaspersky laboratory case." Shaheen contacted the Latvian government to confirm the caller's credentials, but the embassy responded that the outreach attempt was fake.
