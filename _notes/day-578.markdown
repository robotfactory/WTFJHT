1. **White House counsel Don McGahn has cooperated extensively with Mueller's obstruction probe, and Trump's team doesn't know what he told the special counsel.** Trump says he allowed McGahn to "fully cooperate" with Mueller's investigation into obstruction of justice. McGahn has given investigators three voluntary interviews lasting a total of 30 hours over the last nine months. Trump's lawyers don't know exactly what McGahn said, and McGahn has provided only a limited accounting of what he told investigators.

2. **Trump referred to lawyers working for Mueller as "thugs" and called Mueller "disgraced and discredited" on Twitter this morning.** "Disgraced and discredited Bob Mueller and his whole group of Angry Democrat Thugs," Trump tweeted, "spent over 30 hours with the White House Councel \[*sic*\], only with my approval, for purposes of transparency." Trump also once again referred to Mueller's investigation as a "witch hunt" and called the special counsel's team of prosecutors "a National Disgrace!"

3. **Giuliani claimed that "truth isn't truth" while trying to explain why Trump shouldn't testify in Mueller's investigation into obstruction of justice.** Giuliani said Mueller could be trying to trap Trump into telling a lie, which could lead to a perjury charge. "When you tell me that, you know, he should testify because he’s going to tell the truth and he shouldn’t worry," Giuliani told Chuck Todd on Meet the Press, "well that’s so silly because it’s somebody’s version of the truth. Not the truth." When Todd pushed back and said "Truth is truth," Giuliani responded by declaring, "No, no, it isn’t truth. Truth isn’t truth."

4. **Michael Cohen is under investigation for more than $20 million in bank and tax fraud.** Federal authorities are investigating a series of loans obtained by taxi business that Cohen and his family own. Investigators are also looking into whether Cohen violated campaign finance or other laws by helping to silence women who said they had affairs with Trump. Prosecutors are considering filing charges by the end of this month. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/19/nyregion/michael-cohen-loans-donald-trump.html))

5. **Michael Cohen's attorney says he has been talking to John Dean over the last few months.** Dean is the former White House counsel who helped bring down Richard Nixon, and Cohen has been signaling that he might cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigations into Trump. "I certainly don’t want to raise expectations that Mr. Cohen has anything like the level of deep involvement and detailed knowledge that John Dean had in the Nixon White House as a witness to Nixon’s crimes," Cohen's attorney said, "but I did see some similarities and wanted to learn from what John went through."

6. **One of Trump's speechwriters was fired last week after he was revealed to have spoken at a conference attended by well-known white nationalists.** Darren Beattie, who was a visiting instructor at Duke University before he joined the White House speechwriting team, was fired on Friday after a media inquiry about his speech at the 2016 H.L. Mencken Club conference, where he spoke on a panel alongside white nationalist Peter Brimelow.
