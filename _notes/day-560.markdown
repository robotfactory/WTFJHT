2. **Muellerâ€™s office wants to ask Trump about obstruction of justice, among other topics, both orally and in written form.** Mueller has offered to limit the scope of his in-person questions for Trump if Trump agrees to an in-person interview. Trump's legal team has sought special conditions for a sit-down interview and has requested that some topics should be off-limits, including any questions about actions Trump has taken while in office. Trump told his advisers that he is eager to meet with Mueller and has urged his lawyers in recent days to reach an agreement on a sit-down interview with the special counsel, despite their warnings that he should not answer investigator's questions. Hours after receiving an update about the ongoing negotiations with the special counsel's office, Trump tweeted at Jeff Sessions and called on him to shut down the Mueller probe.
