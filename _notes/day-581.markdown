1. **Trump says he would consider pardoning his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort**, according to Fox News host Ainsley Earhardt. "I think he feels bad for Manafort," Ainsley said. "They were friends." Manafort was convicted on Tuesday of an array of bank and tax fraud charges.  In a tweet on Wednesday, Trump called Manafort a "brave man" and said, "I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family."

2. **Top Republicans in the Senate are warning Trump that it would be a mistake to pardon Manafort.** "It would be an enormous mistake and misuse of his power to pardon," said Sen. Susan Collins. The second-ranking Republican senator, GOP Whip John Cornyn also said that a pardon "would be a mistake." Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker said that a pardon "would be very damaging to the presidency and to his position as president."

3. **One of the jurors in Paul Manfort's trial claims just one holdout juror prevented Manafort from being convicted on all 18 counts.** Paula Duncan, who identifies as a Trump supporter, said the single holdout juror could not come to a guilty verdict on 10 of the charges, leading Judge T.S. Ellis III to declare a mistrial on those 10 counts.

4. **Trump claimed the felony counts that Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to on Tuesday "weren't crimes."** "What Michael Cohen pled to weren't crimes," Trump said during an interview on Fox News. "He made a great deal. He was in another business totally unrelated to me where I guess there was fraud involved," Trump said, referring to Cohen's violations of campaign finance laws. "He makes a better deal when he uses me." Trump also tried to distance himself from Cohen, saying, "He worked for me, you could say more or less part time. He had other clients."

5. **Trump said that "flipping" on someone and cooperating with prosecutors is "not fair" and should "almost be outlawed."** Trump complained during an interview with Fox News about former confidants who testified against him to mitigate their own legal troubles. "It's called flipping and it almost ought to be illegal." Trump said he has been watching people flip for decades: "I know all about flipping, 30, 40 years I have been watching flippers. Everything is wonderful and then they get 10 years in jail and they flip on whoever the next highest one is or as high as you can go." He continued: "It almost ought to be outlawed. It's not fair."

6. **Trump's latest round of tariffs kicked in today, which were followed immediately by retaliatory tariffs from China.** The U.S. imposed 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion in Chinese goods, affecting 279 Chinese products. China immediately responded with 25 percent tariffs of their own on an equal amount of American goods, such as chemical products and diesel fuel. Both countries have now imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of each other's goods â€” and more tariffs are reportedly on the way.

7. **Betsy DeVos is considering a plan to allow school districts to use federal funding to buy guns for teachers**, according to multiple people with knowledge of the plan. The plan, if enacted, would be unprecedented and would reverse a longstanding position of the federal government that federal funding should not be used to outfit schools with weapons. Congress passed a $50 million-a-year school safety bill in March that specifically prohibited using the money to buy firearms, but DeVos is apparently looking to a program in federal education law that doesn't mention a specific prohibition on purchasing weapons with federal education funding.

8. **After [claiming on Wednesday](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2018/08/22/day-580/#8-the-democratic-national-committee) that it experienced an attack on its voter database, the DNC now says the apparent phishing attempts were a "test."** The DNC released a statement late Wednesday night claiming that it believes the phishing attempt was part of an unauthorized test of its VoteBuilder system by a third party. "We, along with the partners who reported the site," the DNC statement reads, "now believe it was built by a third party as part of a simulated phishing test on VoteBuilder." The statement continues: "The test, which mimicked several attributes of actual attacks on the Democratic party's voter file, was not authorized by the DNC, VoteBuilder nor any of our vendors."

9. **Trump asked Sec. of State Mike Pompeo to study the "seizing land from white farmers" and the "large scale killing of farmers" in South Africa.** The BBC found in November that there was "no reliable data to suggest farmers were at greater risk of being murdered than the average South African." South Africa responded and accused Trump of seeking to sow division in the country. The redistribution of land in South Africa was a fundamental principle of the African National Congress (ANC) after the fall of apartheid. Now, 24 years after apartheid ended, government figures show that white people (who make up 9 percent of the population) own 72 percent of the farmland held by individuals.
