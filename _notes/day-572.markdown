1. **Top White House officials were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements that prevents them from writing tell-all books once they leave the Trump administration.** A seemingly innocuous clause was embedded in the White House's two-page non-disclosure agreement that prohibits top aides from disclosing confidential information in the form of books without Trump's express permission. If aides violate those terms, the non-disclosure agreement stipulates that they would be required to forfeit any royalties or earnings to the U.S. government.

2. **Trump called Trump Jr. "a fuckup" after he released his emails about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer**, according to Omarosa's forthcoming book. The book says Trump erupted in anger after Omarosa mentioned that Trump Jr. had released screenshots of his email exchanges with Rob Goldstone on Twitter. "He is such a fuckup," Trump said. "He screwed up again, but this time, heâ€™s screwing us all, big-time!" ([NY Daily News](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-news-trump-junior-emails-russian-lawyer-20180813-story.html)) 

3. **Omarosa released audio of Trump campaign aides discussing how to handle the potential release of a tape of Trump using the "n-word."** Trump claims he never said the word, saying that "I don't have that word in my vocabulary and never have" and that Omarosa "made it up." But the audio appears to corroborate Omarosa's claims that Trump aides were aware of the recording and talked about how to handle it.

4. **Omarosa also claims to have recordings of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.** She claims to have recorded private phone calls from Kushner and Ivanka, during which the couple offer their condolences in the wake of her firing by John Kelly last year.

5. **Paul Manfort sent recommendations for senior White House positions to Jared Kushner in late 2016.** Manafort sent Kushner a recommendation to appoint the chair of the Federal Savings Bank, Stephen Calk, as Secretary of the Army around the same time that Manafort received the first part of what would be $16 million in loans from Calk's bank. He also suggests two other appointees: Pat Sink and Vernon Parker. "The 3 indivituals (sic) are people who I believe advance DT agenda," Manfort wrote in an email to Kushner. "They will be totally reliable and responsive to the Trump White House." That same day, Kushner responded: "On it!"
