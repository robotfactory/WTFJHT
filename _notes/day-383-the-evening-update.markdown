1. **Trump wants a grand military parade with soldiers marching and tanks** later this year to showcase the might of America's armed forces. "The marching orders were: I want a parade like the one in France," a military official said. From the Washington Post: "The inspiration for Trump’s push is last year’s Bastille Day celebration in Paris, which the president attended as a guest of French President Emmanuel Macron. Trump was awestruck by the tableau of uniformed French troops marching down Avenue des Champs-Elysees with military tanks, armored vehicles, gun trucks and carriers — complete with fighter jets flying over the Arc de Triomphe and painting the sky with streaks of blue, white and red smoke for the colors of the French flag."
