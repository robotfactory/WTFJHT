1. **Giuliani is preparing a response to Robert Mueller's request for an in-person interview with Trump.** Giuliani says his response will largely rebuff Mueller's latest offer of a presidential interview that includes questions about obstruction of justice and express the Trump team's "real reluctance about allowing any questions about obstruction." Giuliani expects to continue negotiating with Mueller, instead of simply rejecting Mueller's request out of hand. "The president still hasn’t made a decision," Giuliani added, "and we’re not going to make a final decision just yet."

2. **The Trump administration wants to make it harder for legal immigrants to become U.S. citizens.** Trump is expected to issue a proposal that would prevent legal immigrants from obtaining citizenship or green cards if they've ever used social programs like Obamacare, children's health insurance, food stamps, and other social benefits programs. The proposal is the brainchild of Trump aide Stephen Miller, and would not require congressional approval. If enacted, it would represent the biggest change to the U.S. legal immigration system in decades, and more than 20 million immigrants could be affected.

3. **Jared Kushner used to personally order the removal of negative stories about his friends and real estate peers while he was in charge of the New York Observer.** Kushner would go around editorial leaders at the Observer and order software developers to remove the stories directly from the Observer's website.

4. **Trump's longtime friends and political allies have created a legal defense fund to pay for White House aides' legal bills as a result of the Mueller investigation.** The largest donation to the fund last quarter came from Geoffrey Palmer, a Los Angeles developer and large Trump political contributor who donated $100,000 to the fund in late June. In total, the fund has raised roughly $200,000 since February. ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/06/trump-allies-legal-defense-fund-russia-probe-764851))
