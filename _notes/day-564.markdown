1. **Trump admitted that the purpose of the Trump Tower meeting in 2016 between top campaign aides and a Russian lawyer was to get dirt on Hillary Clinton.** "Fake News reporting, a complete fabrication, that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son, Donald, had in Trump Tower," Trump tweeted. "This was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere. I did not know about it!" Trump's tweet is in direct conflict with Don Jr.'s statement about the meeting, which was dictated by Trump himself. Don Jr.'s original statement claimed that the primary reason for the meeting was to discuss the adoption of Russian children.

1. **Two of the largest American steel companies, both of which have deep ties to the Trump administration, successfully objected to hundreds of tariff exemption requests by American companies that buy foreign steel.** Nucor and United States Steel objected to 1,600 exemption requests filed with the Commerce Department over the last several months, arguing that companies should not be exempt from the tariffs because the imported products are readily available from American steel manufacturers. The Trump administration established a process for companies to request "exclusions" from the metal tariffs, but the Commerce Department also allowed American companies to challenge exclusion requests. Not a single exclusion challenge by the two companies has failed to date. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/05/us/politics/nucor-us-steel-tariff-exemptions.html))

2. **The hacking collective Anonymous issued a threat against people tied to the budding QAnon-Trump conspiracy, promising to sabotage the operation and expose its followers.** "We have plans," said the Anonymous-affiliated Twitter profile @YourAnonNews [in a video](https://youtu.be/vFHzrmk5Md0). "We will not sit idly by while you take advantage of the misinformed and poorly educated. In our collective we all have our differences and internal drama but we do have one thing in common; none of us are happy with your bullsh\*t." QAnon is a conspiracy theory that was born on the anonymous message board, 4chan, and broadly suggests that Trump is working behind the scenes to expose a global network of pedophiles and child traffickers among the upper echelons of the U.S. government.

3. **Trump signed an executive order to reimpose several sanctions against Iran.** Three months after unilaterally pulling the U.S. out of the "horrible, one-sided" Iran Nuclear Deal, Trump said today's move is mean to exert "maximum economic pressure" against Iran. Trump also warned all other countries "to make clear that the Iranian regime faces a choice: either change its threatening, destabilizing behavior and reintegrate with the global economy, or continue down a path of economic isolation."
