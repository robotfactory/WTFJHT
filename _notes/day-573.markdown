2. **Omarosa claims Betsy DeVos said the black students who booed her 2017 commencement speech lack the "capacity to understand" what she's trying to accomplish.** Omarosa describes DeVos' comments in her book, "meaning, all those black students were too stupid to understand her agenda." She also goes after DeVos for being "woefully inadequate and not equipped for her job." ([Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/14/omarosa-devos-black-college-students-777522))

3. **Sarah Huckabee Sanders apologized for saying that Trump has created three times as many jobs for black people as Obama did during his tenure.** On Tuesday, Sanders claimed that Obama created 195,000 jobs for black people during his eight years in office, while "President Trump in his first year and a half has already tripled what President Obama did in eight years." The statement was false, as black employment between January 2009 and January 2017 increased by 3 million jobs. Since then, black employment has increased by about 700,000 jobs.

4. **One of James Mattis' most senior civilian advisers is under investigation for allegedly retaliating against staff members after she used some of them to run personal errands and conduct personal business.** Dana White, the Pentagon's chief spokeswoman, has been under investigation for several weeks and is alleged to have misused support staff by asking them to, among other things, fetch her laundry, go to the pharmacy for her, and take care of her mortgage paperwork.

5. **The U.S. Treasury Department has delayed turning over crucial financial records related to the Russia probe and has refused to provide an expert to make sense of the complex money trail in the investigation.** Some of the department's own personnel have even questioned whether the Treasury is intentionally impeding the investigation. At one point, the Treasury Dept. went at least four months before responding to a Senate Intelligence Committee request for sensitive financial documents.

6. **Roger Stone posted a Nazi Space Force meme on his Instagram before deleting it after public outcry.** "I love this," Stone wrote in his original post. "Proud to be in this crew — but the only lies being told are by liberal scumbags." The caption in the photo read: "In space no one can hear you lie." Stone said he didn't notice the swastikas in the photo. "I love that I was be\[ing\] mocked by the left — it’s a badge of honor," he said. "The image was sent to me by a hater."
