1. **Trump says Jeff Sessions will remain as the attorney general at least until after the midterms**, even as he continued to criticize Sessions for failing to stop Mueller's "illegal investigation." "I just would love to have him do a great job," Trump said Thursday. "I’d love to have him look at the other side." Trump also claimed that "great scholars" have said that "there never should have been a special counsel."

2. **Trump threatened to "get involved" in the Justice Department and "get in there" if the FBI doesn't "start doing their job and doing it right."** Trump once again told a crowd during a Thursday night rally in Indiana that top officials in the FBI and Justice Department are biased against Republicans. "Our Justice Department and our FBI - at the top of each, because inside they have incredible people - but our Justice Department and our FBI have to start doing their job and doing it right and doing it now," Trump told the crowd. "I wanted to stay out, but at some point if it doesn’t straighten out properly ... I will get involved and I’ll get in there if I have to."

3. **Roger Stone says he expects to be charged with a crime in connection with Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.** Stone sent a letter to sympathetic supporters asking for contributions to a legal defense fund. Stone says Mueller's team is attempting "to frame me for some nonexistent crime to silence me and pressure me to testify against the president. ... I am not going to do it."

4. **Trump's disapproval ratings are at an all-time high of 60 percent.** That includes 53 percent who disapprove strongly, with only 36 percent approving — matching his all-time low.
