3. **Trump and his Trump Tower security force must face claims from a group of human rights activists who say they were attacked by Trump's guards in 2015 while protesting Trump's remarks about the Black Lives Matter movement and Mexican immigrants.** A New York State judge denied Trump's motion to dismiss the lawsuit. A jury will now be asked to determine the extent to which the guards were directly ordered to attack the protesters by Trump and whether he personally "authorized and condoned" the attack.

4. **Trump didn't mention Paul Manafort or Michael Cohen once during his rally in West Virginia last night.** Instead, Trump egged on his supporters in the Charleston crowd as they chanted "drain the swamp" and "lock her up." He also reminded the crowd how smart they are. "We’re the smart ones," Trump said at the rally. "Remember, I say it all the time: you hear, 'the elite,' you’re smarter than they are, you have more money than they do...let them have the word elite. You’re the super-elite." Trump also spent a few minutes going after Mueller and calling his investigation a witch hunt.
