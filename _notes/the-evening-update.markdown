* **Trump's lawyers want him to refuse an interview with Robert Mueller**, because they're concerned that he could be charged with lying to investigators. Trump, however, has said that he is eager to speak with Mueller as part of the investigation into possible collusion between his campaign and Russia's election interference, and whether he obstructed justice.

* **Steve Bannon is not expected to appear before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday**, risking being held in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena. The panel wants Bannon to testify a second time in its investigation on Russian election meddling. Bannon's January 16th appearance failed to satisfy members of the committee.
