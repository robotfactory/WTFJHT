1. **Omarosa released two secret audio recordings she made: One of John Kelly firing her from inside the Situation Room and one of a phone call she had with Trump after she was fired.** The second recording appears to show that Trump had no idea that Kelly fired her. Current White House staffers are looking into possible legal action to prevent Omarosa from releasing any more tapes and to punish her for secretly recording John Kelly in the Situation Room.

2. **Stephen Miller's uncle wrote an op-ed calling his nephew an "immigration hypocrite."** "If my nephew’s ideas on immigration had been in force a century ago," David Glosser writes, "our family would have been wiped out." Glosser's rebuke of his nephew continued: "I have watched with dismay and increasing horror as my nephew, who is an educated man and well aware of his heritage, has become the architect of immigration policies that repudiate the very foundation of our family’s life in this country."

3. **The White House is proposing changes to a law that's designed to protect military personnel from getting cheated by shady lending and financial practices.** The administration is also taking broader steps to curtail enforcement of the Military Loan Act, which protects service members from predatory loans and other financial products. Critics say the changes would leave service members vulnerable to getting ripped off by car dealers, among others.
