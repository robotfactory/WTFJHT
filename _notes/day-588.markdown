1. **The Trump administration has been denying passports to U.S. citizens and accusing hundreds of Latinos along the southern border of using fake birth certificates to obtain citizenship.** The State Department said it "has not changed policy or practice regarding the adjudication of passport applications," but news reports suggest a dramatic shift in both immigration enforcement and the way passports are issued. Some passport applicants with U.S. birth certificates are being imprisoned at immigration detention centers and entered into deportation proceedings, while others have had their passports revoked when trying to reenter the United States.

2. **George Papadopoulos decided to accept a plea deal from Robert Mueller and plead guilty to lying to the FBI.** He admitted to lying to the FBI about his contacts during the campaign with a professor who had "substantial connections to Russian government officials." Padadopoulos was strongly considering backing away from the deal earlier this month, but decided to accept the deal and cooperate with Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

3. **Trump accused NBC of "fudging" his May 2017 interview during which Trump admitted that his decision to fire James Comey was related to the Russia investigation.** Comey was the FBI director at the time and was in charge of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. During the NBC interview, Trump admitted that he had "this Russia thing" in mind when he decided to fire Comey. On Thursday, Trump accused NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt on Twitter of "fudging my tape on Russia," but provided no evidence to support the accusation.

4. **Trump also lashed out at top NBC and CNN executives on Twitter and called on AT&T to fire CNN chief Jeff Zucker.** "The hatred and extreme bias of me by @CNN has clouded their thinking and made them unable to function," Trump tweeted. "But actually, as I have always said, this has been going on for a long time. Little Jeff Z has done a terrible job, his ratings suck, & AT&T should fire him to save credibility!" He also predicted that NBC News chairman Andrew Lackey will be fired. "What’s going on at @CNN," Trump tweeted, "is happening, to different degrees, at other networks - with @NBCNews being the worst. The good news is that Andy Lack(y) is about to be fired(?) for incompetence, and much worse. When Lester Holt got caught fudging my tape on Russia, they were hurt badly!"

5. **Trump appeared to admit via tweet that he tried to fire Robert Mueller.** "I am very excited about the person who will be taking the place of Don McGahn as White House Councel! \[*sic*\]" Trump tweeted. "I liked Don, but he was NOT responsible for me not firing Bob Mueller or Jeff Sessions. So much Fake Reporting and Fake News!" Trump has denied that he has tried to fire Mueller in the past, calling the claims "Fake News, folks. Fake News."

6. **Trump and Michael Cohen planned in 2016 to buy up all the damaging information that the National Enquirer and its parent company American Media Inc. had compiled about Trump**, dating all the way back to the 1980s. The plan was never finalized, but Trump and Cohen appear to mention it during a recorded conversation between the two that was released by Cohen's attorney last month. "It’s all the stuff — all the stuff, because you never know," Cohen says on the tape. American Media Inc. chairman and CEO David Pecker has reportedly been cooperating with special counsel investigators for months.

7. **Trump blamed China for derailing the rapprochement process between the U.S. and North Korea**, suggesting that China is putting "tremendous pressure" on Pyongyang as a result of the ongoing trade disputes between the two economic superpowers. Trump issued four tweets – what he called a White House statement – saying that he "feels strongly that North Korea is under tremendous pressure from China because of our major trade disputes with the Chinese Government." During the same tweetstorm, Trump said his relationship with Kim Jong Un was "a very good and warm one," and referred to the Chinese leader as "China’s great President Xi Jinping."

8. **Trump called on the U.S. Supreme Court chief justice to tell the head of the FISA Court to question FBI and Justice Department officials about the use of the Steele dossier in the Russia probe.** "This is a fraud on the court," Trump tweeted. "The Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court is in charge of the FISA court. He should direct the Presiding Judge, Rosemary Collier \[*sic*\], to hold a hearing, haul all of these people from the DOJ & FBI in there, & if she finds there were crimes committed, and there were, there should be a criminal referral by her." Judge Rosemary Collyer presides over the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court, which oversees electronic surveillance and search warrant requests from federal authorities.

9. **White House ethics lawyer Stefan Passatino is leaving the Trump administration as of tomorrow.** Passatino helped several White House officials grapple with a string of ethics violations and controversies, including Kellyanne Conway's March 2017 violation of of government ethics laws when she told people to "go buy Ivanka's stuff" during an interview on Fox News.
