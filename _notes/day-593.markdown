 1. **Trump kicked off Labor Day by attacking a top union leader.** Trump tweeted that AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka "represented his union poorly on television this weekend." Trump added: "It is easy to see why unions are doing so poorly. A Dem!" The attack came after Trumka appeared on Fox News and criticized Trump's attempts to overhaul NAFTA, claiming that the agreement should include Canada. "The things that he's done to hurt workers outpace what he's done to help workers," Trumka said. ([ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-attacks-union-leader-labor-day-57572623))

 2. **The Trump administration is rolling back worker safety regulations affecting underground mine safety inspections, offshore oil rigs, line speeds in meat processing plants, and others.** Under Obama, workplace inspections at mines had to occur before workers started their shifts, but the Trump administration said it would allow inspections to begin while miners were already working. The Interior Department is seeking to roll back regulations for offshore oil rigs that were put in place after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, rescinding the rule that inspections of blowout preventers must only be conducted by government-approved third parties. And the Agricultural Department is considering lifting line speed requirements in hog processing plants.

 3. **The Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago is being sued by the Illinois attorney general for multiple violations of clean water laws and for endangering fish and other aquatic life in the Chicago River.** The tower is one of the city's largest users of river water for its cooling systems, and is accused of failing to meet several requirements in a state permit that are intended to limit the number of fish pinned against intake screens or killed by sudden pressure and temperature changes. Building managers also failed to renew its permit and have been operating the cooling system without it for almost a year. "Trump Tower continues to take millions of gallons of water from the Chicago River every day without a permit and without any regard to how it may be impacting the river’s ecosystem," Attorney General Lisa Madigan said in a statement. "I filed my lawsuit to make sure Trump Tower cannot continue violating the law."

 4. **The Kremlin dismissed Trump's warning to the Syrian government not to attack a rebel-held stronghold in Idlib province.** Trump warned Bashar al-Assad and his allies in Iran and Russia on Monday not to "recklessly attack" Syria's northwestern province, saying that hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. The Kremlin responded by claiming that the province was a "nest of terrorism" and saying that the presence of militants in Idlib was undermining the Syrian peace process. Russian forces resumed air strikes against insurgents in Idlib on Tuesday after a hiatus that lasted a few weeks.

 5. **The New Yorker pulled Steve Bannon as a headliner at the New Yorker Festival after several high-profile dropouts and rebukes from staff and subscribers**. John Mulaney, Judd Apatow, Jack Antonoff, and Jim Carrey all dropped out within 30 minutes of each other after Bannon was announced as a headliner. The New Yorker's editor, David Remnick, sent an email to staff Monday evening announcing that Bannon will no longer appear as a headliner. Bannon called Remnick "gutless" for rescinding his invitation. ([New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/arts/bannon-new-yorker-festival-remnick.html))

 6. **Another 42,000 pages of documents related to Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, were released Monday night, just hours before Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings were set to begin.** The Trump administration decided to claim executive privilege and withhold some 100,000 documents related to Kavanaugh's time in the George W. Bush administration. Before serving in the Bush administration, Kavanaugh was a key deputy to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and supported tough questioning of President Clinton about his encounters with Monica Lewinsky. Later, Kavanaugh wrote an article in 2009 for the Minnesota Law Review that claimed any civil and criminal investigations of a president should take place only once the president is out of office, due to the fact that they are "time-consuming and distracting."

 7. **Robert Mueller's investigation into possible obstruction of justice and Russian interference in the 2016 election will continue, despite Rudy Giuliani's claims that the probe should have ended on Sept. 1.** Giuliani claimed that the Sept. 1 deadline was part of Justice Department guidelines that prohibited investigators from improperly affecting the midterm elections on Nov. 6.

 8. **Giuliani said the White House will likely attempt to block a full public release of Mueller's final report on his Russia investigation.** Giuliani once again described the special counsel's investigation as a "witch hunt," and said that the White House would "object to the public disclosure of information that might be covered by executive privilege." When asked whether the White House would raise objections to the publication of the full report, Giuliani said, "“I’m sure we will," and noted that Trump would be the one who "would make the final call."

 9. **Republicans are considering dropping an effort to push a second phase of tax cuts that includes a $10,000 annual cap on state and local tax deductions.** Party leaders are concerned that the effort may antagonize voters in hotly contested Congressional districts.

10. **Omarosa recorded nearly every conversation she had while working in the White House, including conversations she had with "all of the Trumps."** She did so using her personal cellphone, which was almost always on record mode. She carried two phones with her — her personal phone and a government-issued phone — and often put conversations she had on her work phone on speaker, allowing her to record the audio with her personal phone.
