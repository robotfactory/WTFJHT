1. **The New York City Department of Buildings cited Kushner Companies for 42 violations and $210,000 in fines for submitting false permit information at 17 buildings in an attempt to remove rent-regulated tenants.** The company claims that the violations were "paperwork errors" and will have the opportunity to contest the citations. Tenant activists also issued a report that suggests an investment group led by Michael Cohen falsified construction permits by claiming that three buildings in Manhattan were vacant or had no rent-controlled tenants, when in fact they did.

2. **Trump attacked Google in a pair of tweets and claimed that "Google search results for 'Trump News' shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake New Media."** He continued: "In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me & others, so that almost all stories & news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative & Fair Media is shut out. Illegal?" Trump also claimed that he had studied the search results and concluded that "96 per cent of results on 'Trump News' are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous." Trump claimed that "Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good," and warned that "They are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!"

3. **A panel of three federal judges ruled on Monday that North Carolina's congressional district maps were unconstitutionally gerrymandered in favor of Republicans, and said that it may require new maps to be drawn before the midterm elections.** The judges said they were reluctant to allow voting to take place in districts that have twice been found to violate constitutional standards, even though primary elections have already produced candidates for the 2018 elections. North Carolina legislators are likely to ask to the Supreme Court to hear the case.

4. **Manafort's defense team met with prosecutors to discuss a second set of charges against him before he was convicted last week, but they were unable to reach a deal.** The discussions over the second set of charges stalled over issues raised by Mueller, although the specific issues in question remain unclear. The point of the talks was to prevent a second, related trial for Manafort, which is scheduled for Sept. 17. Prosecutors and defense attorneys have been arguing over how to describe the second case to the jury, as well as which pieces of evidence can be presented during the trial.

5. **Lanny Davis says he was an anonymous source for a CNN story published in July that claimed his client, Michael Cohen, said privately that he Trump knew in advance about the infamous Trump Tower meeting between Trump Jr. and Russians.** The story said Cohen claimed to have personally witnessed Trump Jr. informing his father about the June 2016 meeting. Davis admitted that he served as an anonymous source for multiple news outlets seeking to confirm the story after CNN published it. Now, Davis says he is not certain that the claim is accurate and he regrets his role as anonymous source and his subsequent denial of his involvement in the reporting. Other news outlets that originally confirmed CNN's reporting have since retracted their own stories, but CNN has not. "We stand by our story," CNN said in a statement, "and are confident in our reporting of it."

6. **Trump issued a proclamation of praise for Sen. John McCain and ordered the American flag to be flown at half-staff again after coming under immense public pressure.** Trump had ordered the flag back to full-staff just two days after McCain's death, sparking outrage from both lawmakers and members of the public, including many in his own party.
