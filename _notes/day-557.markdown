1. **Trump accused journalists of endangering American lives and being unpatriotic by revealing "internal deliberations of our government."** In a series of tweets on Sunday, Trump said he "will not allow our great country to be sold out by anti-Trump haters in the dying newspaper industry" who are "driven insane by their Trump Derangement Syndrome." Trump singled out the New York Times and the Washington Post after A. G. Sulzberger, the publisher of the Times, released a statement about an off-the-record meeting between the two. Sulzberger said in a statement that he disclosed details of the meeting because Trump "put the meeting on the record" by tweeting about it.

1. **The federal judge overseeing the reunification of 2,551 migrant children separated from their families at the border ordered the Trump administration to provide detailed information about the location of "missing parents" the government deemed ineligible for reunification.** Judge Dana Sabraw ordered the Trump administration to turn over a list by Wednesday of all parents who have been deemed "ineligible," including those who have already been deported, released into the United States, and those who were not reunited due to a criminal history. As of Friday, 650 children remain separated because their parents had been deemed ineligible.

2. **The government has been secretly monitoring U.S. citizens when they fly since at least 2010.** Federal air marshals have been tracking and monitoring airline passengers as part of a secret TSA program called "Quiet Skies," which specifically targets travelers who "are not under investigation by any agency and are not in the Terrorist Screening Data Base." All U.S. citizens who enter the country are automatically screened for potential inclusion in the program, and remain on the Quiet Skies watch list for up to 90 days or three encounters. They are never notified that they're on the list. It is still unclear what qualifies someone to be placed on the watch list in the first place, and the full checklist is still a mystery even to the marshals who are charged with conducting the surveillance.

3. **A group of 36 people whose visas were denied or put on hold under Trump's travel ban are suing the administration in the first lawsuit involving the ban since it was upheld by the Supreme Court in June.** The suit names Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and various other government agencies as the defendants. The suit doesn't challeng the constitutionality of the ban, but instead asks the administration to explain how it grants waivers under the ban. The Trump administration says it makes exceptions for people in particularly compelling circumstances, but there is substantial evidence that very few people were receiving such waivers.

4. **Trump renewed his accusations against Robert Mueller in a series of tweets on Sunday, claiming that Mueller has "conflicts of interest" in his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.** Trump also noted that he and Mueller had "a very nasty & contentious business relationship," and appeared to confirm [a New York Times report from January](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/politics/trump-mueller-special-counsel-russia.html) that said Trump tried to fire Mueller in June 2017 over alleged conflicts of interest. Trump also tweet-claimed that Mueller's team was packed with Democrats, falsely claimed that Mueller's probe was borne out of the Steele dossier, and pondered why Mueller wasn't investigating Democrats.

1. **Trump threatened to shut down the federal government if Democrats don't agree to sweeping changes to U.S. immigration laws, including appropriating more public money to build his proposed border wall.** "I would be willing to ‘shut down’ government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security, which includes the Wall!” Trump tweeted on Sunday. "Must get rid of Lottery, Catch & Release etc. and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT! We need great people coming into our Country!" Trump faced immediate words of caution from top Republican lawmakers, including the head of the National Republican Congressional Committee and the chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.

2. **Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court sided with Trump Entertainment Resorts in a 2012 case that stopped a unionization drive at one of its casinos.** Brett Kavanaugh was one of three Republican-appointed judges who voted unanimously to ignore an order from the National Labor Relations Board that would have required the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City to bargain with the United Auto Workers. Labor advocates point to the case as evidence that Kavanaugh will kneecap the enforcement of workplace labor laws and the already-weakened U.S. labor union movement.

3. **A lengthy stretch of dunes in Aberdeenshire, Scotland has been "partially destroyed" by the construction of Trump's new golf course**, according to documents released under the Freedom of Information Act. Scottish Natural Heritage acknowledged that serious damage has been done to the site of a Specific Scientific Interest at Foveran Links since the course opened in 2012.
