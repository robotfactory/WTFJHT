1. **Trump canceled his military parade, blaming "the local politicians who run Washington, D.C. (poorly)" for the parade's exorbitant price tag.** "When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade," Trump tweeted, "they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it. Never let someone hold you up!" The expected cost of the parade ballooned from an estimated $12 million to $92 million. The Pentagon had already postponed the parade until 2019 as of Thursday before Trump decided to cancel it via tweet this morning.

2. **Trump told his advisers that he is eager to revoke more security clearances of people who have been critical of him or who played a role in Robert Mueller's Russia probe.** According to his aides, Trump believes he came out looking strong after he revoked former CIA director John Brennan's security clearance on Thursday, adding that Trump shows visible disdain for Brennan when he sees him on TV.
