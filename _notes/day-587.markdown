1. **White House counsel Don McGahn is expected to step down this fall after the midterms or after Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court.** Sources say McGahn's successor will likely be Emmet Flood, an attorney who advised the Clinton administration during his impeachment hearings and served as White House counsel under George W. Bush. McGahn has said privately that after he steps down he plans to continue assisting Trump throughout his reelection campaign.

2. **Trump has been reviving the possibility of firing Jeff Sessions during private conversations with his aides and personal lawyers this month.** Trump's attorneys believe that they have, at least for now, persuaded Trump not to fire Sessions while the Russia investigation is still under way. Senate Republicans are reportedly starting to accept that Trump may ultimately end up firing Sessions after the midterm elections.

3. **Trump warned evangelical leaders that Democrats "will overturn everything that we’ve done and they’ll do it quickly and violently" if Republicans lose their congressional majority in the midterms.** "They will end everything immediately," Trump told the group in the State Dining Room on Monday, "When you look at antifa and you look at some of these groups, these are violent people."

4. **Trump accused China on Twitter of hacking Hillary Clinton's emails during the 2016 presidential campaign.** "Hillary Clinton’s Emails, many of which are Classified Information, got hacked by China," Trump tweeted. "Next move better be by the FBI & DOJ or, after all of their other missteps (Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Ohr, FISA, Dirty Dossier etc.), their credibility will be forever gone!" In an earlier tweet, Trump joked that Russia might be the culprit: "China hacked Hillary Clinton’s private Email Server. Are they sure it wasn’t Russia (just kidding!)? What are the odds that the FBI and DOJ are right on top of this? Actually, a very big story. Much classified information!" Trump offered no evidence to support his claims.

5. **Giuliani was paid to lobby the Romanian president on behalf of a global consulting firm, but the position he was paid to take contradicted the U.S. government's official position.** Giuliani was being paid by Freeh Group International Solutions when he sent a letter to President Klaus Iohannis last week criticizing the "excesses" of Romania's National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA), contradicting the U.S. State Department's support for the Romanian agency. Although Giuliani did not claim to represent the views of the Trump administration, Giuliani did not disclose in the letter that he was acting on behalf of another client. Romanian politicians who are trying to stem the influence of the DNA have already used Giuliani's letter to sow doubt about the U.S. government’s position.

6. **Leaked emails reveal that a former Homeland Security policy analyst who resigned last week has ties to white nationalists.** The emails show that Ian M. Smith had previously been in contact with a group that included known white nationalists as they planned some of their events. One email was addressed to, among other people, prominent white nationalist leader Richard Spencer. Another email includes Jared Taylor, founder of the white nationalist publication American Renaissance. "I no longer work at DHS as of last week," Smith said when contacted via email, "and didn't attend any of the events you've mentioned."

7. **Leaders from Japan and North Korea held a secret meeting in Vietnam last month without informing the United States.** Japan decided not to tell the U.S. about the meeting because of growing concerns that it can't rely on the U.S. to lobby on its behalf about key domestic issues in North Korea such as the abduction of Japanese citizens. The decision to keep the U.S. out of the loop about the meeting reportedly caused "irritation" among top officials.
