1. **Microsoft says it has identified attempts by a Russian hacking group to infiltrate U.S. candidates, campaigns and political groups.** Microsoft received permission from a federal court last week to take down malicious websites that mimicked the login pages of the Senate, the Microsoft Office 365 email platform, and two conservative think tanks. The Kremlin-linked hacking group Fancy Bear used the websites to try to trick targets into handing over their passwords. Microsoft says it has no evidence that the group was successful, but it remains "concerned that these latest attempts pose security threats to a broadening array of groups connected with both American political parties in the run-up to the 2018 elections."

2. **Trump said he is worried that any statements he makes to Robert Mueller under oath will be used to bring perjury charges against him.** "So if I say something and he (Comey) says something," Trump said in an interview, "and it’s my word against his, and he’s best friends with Mueller, so Mueller might say: ‘Well, I believe Comey,’ and even if I’m telling the truth, that makes me a liar. That’s no good." Trump refused to confirm or deny whether he would ultimately agree to an interview with Mueller. He also refused to say whether he would strip Mueller of his security clearance. "I haven’t given it a lot of thought," Trump said.

3. **Trump denied reports that he is considering restricting President Obama's access to intelligence briefings.** Trump says the move is something he "never discussed or thought of." Reports claimed that then-national security adviser H.R. McMaster had previously talked Trump out of the idea, which some in the White House were pushing last year after Trump claimed that Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower during the 2016 election.

4. **Mick Mulvaney, Trump's budget director, is trying to use his influence to protect a South Carolina company from the negative effects of Trump's trade policies.** Mulvaney is a former South Carolina congressman, and he has been making personal pleas to administration officials to protect Element Electionics, a TV assembly plant in his old district. The company has said that it will have to cease operations because of Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods. ([McClatchy DC](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article217018380.html))
