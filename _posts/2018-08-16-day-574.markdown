1/ **Rudy Giuliani said Trump's legal team is prepared to fight a subpoena all the way to the Supreme Court.** "We would move to quash the subpoena," Giuliani said, "and we're pretty much finished with our memorandum opposing a subpoena." Giuliani added that Trump's legal team is ready to "argue it before the Supreme Court, if it ever got there." Trump's lawyers plan to argue that a sitting president cannot be indicted by citing Article II of the Constitution and a 2000 memo from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel following Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky.

2/ **Robert Mueller doesn't have to shut down his investigation before the midterms despite claims by Trump's lawyers that he faces a September 1st deadline**, according to current and former U.S. officials. Giuliani, meanwhile, said that if Mueller "doesn't get it done in the next two or three weeks we will just unload on him like a ton of bricks."

3/ **Trump admitted that he revoked John Brennan's security clearance because of his role in the Russia investigation.** "I call it the rigged witch hunt, \[it\] is a sham," Trump said. "And these people led it. So I think it’s something that had to be done." Brennan [called](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/opinion/john-brennan-trump-russia-collusion-security-clearance.html) Trump's claims of "no collusion" with Russia to influence the 2016 election "hogwash" and that Trump "clearly has become more desperate to protect himself and those close to him, which is why he made the politically motivated decision to revoke my security clearance in an attempt to scare into silence others who might dare to challenge him."

* **The retired commander of the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command who oversaw the 2011 Navy SEAL raid in Pakistan that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden**: "I would consider it an honor if you would revoke my security clearance as well, so I can add my name to the list of men and women who have spoken up against your presidency." ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/revoke-my-security-clearance-too-mr-president/2018/08/16/8b149b02-a178-11e8-93e3-24d1703d2a7a_story.html?utm_term=.56d921baaeb6))

4/ **Trump defended his trade policies and claimed that his steel tariffs will save the U.S. steel industry because the United States was "built on Tariffs, and Tariffs are now leading us to great new Trade Deals."** He said steel prices in the short term will be "a little more expensive," but claimed they will eventually drop. He also said competition will be "internal, like it used to be in the old days when we actually had steel, and U.S. Steel was our greatest company."
