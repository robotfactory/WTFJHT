<p class="lead"><strong>So here's the deal:</strong> This is my full-time job. I plan to keep doing this for as long as you keep supporting me. <i>So, if you find my work valuable, please consider becoming a member so I can continue to tell you wtf just happened today</i>.</p>

<p><strong>What's the money for?</strong> WTF Just Happened Today is a newsletter, blog, podcast, and community that chronicles the daily shock and awe in national politics. It's produced every morning by hand and updated throughout the day, with a newsletter sent out every afternoon, Monday through Friday. More than 250,000 people rely on WTFJHT for the day's political news in a concise and focused recap.</p>

<p>Your contributions ensure the continued production of all this and more.</p>

<p>The goal is simple: Make WTFJHT a sustainable, member-funded project that exists for as long as necessary. To do that we need to cover all the costs associated with hosting, email delivery, site search, the community forum, web development, "salary," health insurance, freelancers, the podcast, and more.</p>

<p><strong>WTFJHT Values and Editorial Policy.</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Transparency.</strong> WTFJHT is open source and hosted as a public <a href="https://github.com/mkiser/WTFJHT" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>. Readers are encouraged to improve WTFJHT by making edit requests to fix grammar, typos, facts, sources, etc., as well as to contribute code.</li>
	<li><strong>Neutral-ish.</strong> WTFJHT isn't partisan. It does not offer commentary, opinion, or analysis. Instead, WTFJHT focuses on letting the facts speak for themselves and that's it. Bias is the byproduct of being a human making decisions about the relative importance of things. Sorry.</li>
	<li><strong>Reputable sources.</strong> I always cite and clearly link to the original source material. Where appropriate, I'll include additional sources to other publications reporting the same information.</li>
	<li><strong>Clear expectations.</strong> The premise is simple: state what happened, what the facts are, and cite the source.</li>
	<li><strong>No strings attached.</strong> There's no business model trickery here. No ads. No paywalls. No selling of data. I have a website and a newsletter, and I'm supported directly by my audience.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Still not convinced?</strong> Here's <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/press">what the smartest people on the Internet</a> are saying about What The Fuck Just Happened Today:</p>

<ul>
	<li>"This is the site I’ve been waiting for." –<a href="https://twitter.com/amyoleary/status/827006733142851587" target="_blank">Amy O'Leary</a>, Chief Story Officer and Editorial Director at Upworthy</li>
	<li>"Single subject, distinct tone, clear formatting, total understanding of what its audience wants. @WTFJHT is the best email newsletter." –<a href="https://twitter.com/DaveLeeBBC/status/830907636006547456" target="_blank">Dave Lee</a>, BBC Silicon Valley Reporter</li>
	<li>"@WTFJHT is a brilliant journalistic response to an urgent civic need." –<a href="https://twitter.com/jeffjarvis/status/830562518674317314" target="_blank">Jeff Jarvis</a>, Director, Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism</li>
	<li>"Terrific daily digest. Exemplary news curation. Highly recommended." –<a href="https://twitter.com/pottsmark/status/829547543533146114?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">Mark Potts</a>, Digital Media Entrepreneur</li>

<p><small><strong>Where's the $1/mo option?</strong> Credit card fees on $1 are outrageous and there's nothing I can do about it. 34% of a $1 pledge goes to the credit card processing companies. That's a lot of wasted money compared to a $5 pledge, where "only" 10% is lost to fees. If you still want to support WTFJHT at the equivalent of $1/mo, I'm offering a <a href="https://wtfjht.memberful.com/checkout?plan=26832">$12/yr option</a>.</small></p>

<p><small><strong>Just want to make a one-time contribution?</strong> While recurring memberships are preferred, I'm happy to accommodate four one-time contribution options at <a href="https://wtfjht.memberful.com/checkout?plan=26835">$25</a>, <a href="https://wtfjht.memberful.com/checkout?plan=26836">$50</a>, <a href="https://wtfjht.memberful.com/checkout?plan=26837">$100</a>, and <a href="https://wtfjht.memberful.com/checkout?plan=26838">$200</a>. Or, contribute any amount you want by using <a href="https://www.paypal.me/wtfjht" target="_blank">PayPal</a>.</small></p>

<p><small><strong>What happened to the rewards?</strong> As much as I like stickers, t-shirts, and pins, I found that I was spending too much time at the post office, as well as spending too much money on physical goods. After speaking with members, it became clear that physical rewards are nice, but the real reward is supporting the continued production of WTF Just Happened Today. I plan to open a store to sell stickers and whatnot soon. Hopefully with a partner that can handle fulfillment on my behalf.</p>

<p><small><strong>How much does this thing cost to run anyway?</strong> Glad you asked! I did some back of the envelope math and I came up with $14,979.90/month. That's a pretty conservative estimate, to be honest. If you're interested in how I arrived at that number, I've outlined <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/faq/">the cost of running WTFJHT in the FAQ</a>.</p>
